Questions:

For the explanations, generally a sentence or two should be enough.
Type your answers directly in this file.


1.  Edit solve.cpp to use either of your queue classes to solve Mazes
1, 2, 3, and 4.  Set a large enough delay in the solveMaze function
(like 200000) to watch what's happening.  Do you see why this is called
breadth-first search (BFS)?  How many steps long were your solutions?
How does this compare with DFS?

I see why it's called Breadth-First Search - it would go equally far in each path on the maze until one of them got to a solution. It took a lot longer time in comparison to DFS,
but the trade-off was that it could theoretically get a shorter route: My solution with BFS was 58 steps long with Maze 1, 14 steps with Maze 2, 5 steps with Maze 3, and 90 steps with Maze four.

Depth First search had different behaviour - - it transverses as deep within a path as it can on the maze, then tries another path at the earliest unexplored state,
and then repeats the process going as deep as it can. Depth First Search had a solution that was 58 steps long with Maze 1, 46 steps with Maze 2, 247 steps with Maze 3, and 110 steps with Maze four. It executed quicker, but didn't find as short route. :

With the exception of Maze 3, which was specifically optimized to work well with BFS, DFS was consistently faster but yielded a longer path to the finish. We can see the trade-offs then in general between
BFS and DFS are clear and that each of them has a place, depending on how many times we'll need to find the finish of the maze.  :

2.  Try to solve the blank Sudoku board using your ArrayQueue
and LinkedListQueue classes.  What happens?  Why?

The solver literally tries every single possible state that can exist for the Soduku board. This happens because that's how BFS works - it tries every state until it gets it methodically, which can take longer,
but this yields the fastest route to a solution by incrementing through the states "in order".

3.  Switch to the medium-difficulty Sudoku problem, and comment
out the delay and the print statements in the solveMaze function.
How long does it take to solve the puzzle using your ArrayQueue
class?  Using your LinkedListQueue class?  Is the difference big?

Using ArrayQueue, it took 55.327 (real) seconds.

Using LinkedListQueue, it took 55.988 (real) seconds.

This difference is tiny and trivial - it's small enough that my CPU might just have been busier for this than when I ran ArrayQueue (I have a
few background processes going for my dev environment for work).

4.  Edit solve.cpp to switch to the 4x4 and then 5x5 slider puzzles.
Make sure to comment out the delay and print statements in the solveMaze
function.  How long does it take to solve these puzzles with your
HeapPriorityQueue versus my UnsortedPriorityQueue?  For most students,
mine will be faster?  Why might that happen?  Are the asymptotic
runtimes for the heap versus the unsorted array wrong?

It would be fair to say that the instructor will likely produce a faster program because they are better at choosing efficient code.

I got 7.282s for the runtime of a 4x4 slider puzzle with the unsorted Priority Queue; and 2m 36.292s for the 5x5 puzzle with the UnsortedPriorityQueue;
With the HeapPriorityQueuem I got a time of ___ for the 4x4 slider and ____ for the 5x5 slider.

The asymptotic runtimes are due to the complexity of the problem rising - I predict that the function for the "badness" of a route starts to break down or become ineffective
with this type of puzzle at this large a size. I predict more variance in the time as well with the 4x4 and 5x5 puzzle.

We will be checking your implementations of ArrayQueue, LinkedListQueue,
and HeapPriorityQueue.

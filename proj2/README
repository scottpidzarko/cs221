This project was done without a partner.

Hours spent: ~13. Spent many hours doing the wrong implementation and got put on the correct course by a friend

Assistance: Stackoverflow for looking up debugging errors that were weird since I haven't created classes from scratch for a while
A friend of mine who is in my lab also provided assistance for helping put me on the right track towards using heap as only a priority Queue,
as opposed to using the heap as both the tree and priority Queue.

List of Files:
- huftree.cc for the main program,
- codetree.cc + codetree.h for the implementation of CodeTree
- node.h for the definition of a tree node, used in several other files
- maxheap.h + maxheap.cc for the heap implementation
- the Makefile for make
- moveover.txt provided by the course for testing purposes.

Compiled using make. Ran with ./huftree <text file here>.
